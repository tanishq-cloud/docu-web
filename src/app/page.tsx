              The Smart India Hackathon (SIH) is a premier nationwide initiative
              designed to engage students in solving some of the most pressing
              challenges faced in everyday life. Launched to foster a culture of
              innovation and practical problem-solving, SIH provides a dynamic
              platform for students to develop and showcase their creative
              solutions to real-world problems.
              <br />
              <br />
              Since its inception, SIH has garnered significant success in
              promoting out-of-the-box thinking among young minds, particularly
              engineering students from across India. Each edition has built on
              the previous one, refining its approach and expanding its impact.
              The hackathon not only offers students an opportunity to showcase
              their skills but also encourages collaboration with industry
              experts, government agencies, and other stakeholders.

              <strong>Background:</strong> In todayâ€™s digital age, the ability
              to efficiently manage documents is crucial for organizations.
              However, a significant challenge arises when dealing with
              non-machine-readable documents such as PDFs or Word documents.
              These formats hinder automation and make it difficult to extract
              meaningful insights from the data they contain.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Description:</strong> The TransformoDocs application aims
              to solve this problem by:
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">

                </li>
                <li>

                  scanned, generated, or from other sources.
